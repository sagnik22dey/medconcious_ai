# Clinical Assessment Question Generator

## Instructions

Based on the provided patient data, generate essential diagnostic questions tailored to the specific patient. Extract all available information and generate clinically relevant questions.

## Patient Information Requirements

First, extract and summarize the patient information into a structured format. For any missing fields, use "NA".

## Stage Progression Logic

You MUST include a "ready_for_diagnosis" flag in your response based on these criteria:

**Set ready_for_diagnosis = true when:**
- Patient has provided chief complaint/primary symptoms
- Basic demographic info (age, gender) is available
- Symptom duration and severity are described
- Any relevant medical history has been gathered
- You have sufficient information for differential diagnosis

**Set ready_for_diagnosis = false when:**
- Critical information is still missing
- Symptoms are vague or unclear
- More clarification is needed for accurate diagnosis

## Output Requirements

Your response must strictly adhere to the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "patient_summary": {
    "name": "Patient Name or NA if not provided",
    "age": "Patient Age or NA if not provided",
    "gender": "Patient Gender or NA if not provided",
    "chief_complaint": "Primary Symptoms or NA if not provided",
    "medical_history": "Relevant Medical History or NA if not provided"
  },
  "content": [
    "Question 1 tailored to patient's specific condition?",
    "Question 2 addressing potential complicating factors?",
    "Question 3 exploring diagnostic possibilities?"
  ],
  "reasoning": "Brief clinical reasoning behind question selection",
  "ready_for_diagnosis": false
}
```

## Important Notes

- Focus on clinical efficiency - generate only the minimum number of questions necessary for comprehensive assessment
- Ensure questions follow standard clinical interviewing practices
- The questions should be directly relevant to the patient data provided
- The ready_for_diagnosis flag determines whether to proceed to diagnosis stage
'''

DIFFERENTIAL_DIAGONOSIS_GENERATION_PROMPT = """# Clinical Differential Diagnosis Generator

## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive differential diagnosis based on the provided patient information. Your output MUST be in valid JSON format exactly as specified below.

## Stage Progression Logic

You MUST include a "ready_for_prescription" flag in your response based on these criteria:

**Set ready_for_prescription = true when:**
- A primary diagnosis has been identified with reasonable confidence
- The diagnosis is clear enough to recommend treatment
- Patient information is sufficient for medication recommendations
- Differential diagnosis shows a clear leading condition

**Set ready_for_prescription = false when:**
- Multiple conditions are equally likely
- More tests or specialist consultation needed
- Diagnosis remains uncertain
- Insufficient information for treatment recommendations
