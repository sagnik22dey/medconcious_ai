```

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Google GenAI API Compatibility
- **Issue**: `Part.from_text() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
- **Solution**: Updated API calls to use correct syntax:
  ```python
  # Before (causing errors)
  types.Part.from_text(text=prompt)
  
  # After (working correctly)
  types.Part(text=prompt)
  ```

### 2. Audio Processing Format
- **Implementation**: Using proper `types.Blob` for audio data:
  ```python
  types.Part(
      inline_data=types.Blob(
          data=base64.b64decode(audio_base64),
          mime_type="audio/wav"
      )
  )
  ```

## 🚀 Working Features

### 1. **Direct Voice Processing** ✅
- Base64 audio sent directly to Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview
- Single API call for transcription + AI response
- **Test Result**: 
  - **Input**: "Hi, how are you?" (audio)
  - **Transcription**: "Hi, how are you?"
  - **AI Response**: Professional medical greeting with context

### 2. **Voice-Integrated Greeting** ✅
- Enhanced initiate-chat endpoint with voice support
- **Test Result**:
  - **Transcription**: "Hi, how are you?"
  - **Response**: "Hello John Doe, Welcome to MedConscious.in! I'm here to assist you. How can I help you today?"
  - **Type**: voice_integrated

### 3. **Conversation Stage Processing** ✅
- Context-aware responses based on conversation stage
- **Test Result** (followup stage):
  - **Transcription**: "Hi, how are you?"
  - **Response**: Intelligent follow-up about previously mentioned symptoms (headache and fever)
  - **Stage**: followup

### 4. **Backward Compatibility** ✅
- Traditional text-only greeting still works
- **Test Result**: 
  - **Response**: "Hello Alice Johnson, welcome to MedConscious chat..."
  - **Type**: text_only

## 📋 API Endpoints Successfully Implemented

### Primary Voice Processing
1. **`POST /process-voice-integrated/`** - Main voice processing endpoint ✅
2. **`POST /initiate-chat/`** - Enhanced with voice support ✅

### Traditional Endpoints (Maintained)
3. **`GET /health-check/`** - API status ✅
4. **`POST /process-response/`** - Traditional processing ✅
5. **`POST /generate-diagnosis/`** - Diagnosis generation ✅
6. **`POST /generate-prescription/`** - Prescription generation ✅
7. **`POST /generate-report/`** - Report generation ✅
