# Audio Recording Issues - Fixed

## Problems Identified

1. **Package Conflicts**: 
   - Had both `expo-audio` and `expo-av` packages
   - Code was using `expo-av` but config had `expo-audio` plugin
   - This caused initialization conflicts

2. **Incorrect Plugin Configuration**:
   - `app.json` had `expo-audio` plugin instead of `expo-av`
   - Had unnecessary `expo-speech-recognition` plugin

3. **Audio Mode Configuration Issues**:
   - Complex audio mode settings were causing conflicts
   - `shouldDuckAndroid: true` was problematic
   - Audio mode was being set multiple times

4. **Recording Options Too Complex**:
   - Using preset-based recording which can be unreliable
   - No fallback for different recording formats

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Package.json Changes
- Removed `expo-audio` package
- Removed `expo-speech-recognition` package  
- Kept only `expo-av` for audio recording
- This eliminates package conflicts

### 2. App.json Configuration
- Removed `expo-audio` plugin
- Removed `expo-speech-recognition` plugin
- Added proper `expo-av` plugin with microphone permissions
- Simplified plugin configuration

### 3. Audio Mode Improvements
- Set audio mode only once during permission request
- Simplified audio mode settings:
  ```js
  {
    allowsRecordingIOS: true,
    playsInSilentModeIOS: true,
    staysActiveInBackground: false,
    shouldDuckAndroid: false,  // Changed from true
    playThroughEarpieceAndroid: false,
  }
  ```

### 4. Recording Configuration
- Replaced preset-based recording with explicit options
- Added platform-specific recording settings
- Used more reliable audio formats:
  - Android: MPEG_4 with AAC encoder
  - iOS: MPEG4AAC format
  - 16kHz sample rate for compatibility

### 5. Better Error Handling
- Added recording status checks before stopping
- Improved cleanup in error cases
- More detailed logging for debugging

## Key Code Changes

### useSpeechRecognition.ts
1. **Permission Request**: Now sets audio mode during permission request
2. **Recording Creation**: Uses explicit recording options instead of presets
3. **Error Handling**: Better status checking and cleanup
4. **Simplified Flow**: Removed redundant audio mode settings

### Expected Results
After these fixes, the recording should:
- ✅ Start successfully without "recording not started" errors
- ✅ Capture valid audio data
- ✅ Stop properly without "no valid audio data" errors
- ✅ Generate proper base64 audio data for server processing

## Testing
To test the fixes:
1. Clean build: `npx expo start --clear`
2. Check permissions are granted
3. Try recording - should show "Listening... Speak now"
4. Stop recording - should process and send to server
5. Check console logs for success messages

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Clear Expo cache: `npx expo start --clear`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check device permissions in settings
4. Try on different device/simulator
