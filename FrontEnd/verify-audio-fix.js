ðŸŽ¤ AUDIO RECORDING FIX VERIFICATION
================================

âœ… Fixed Issues:
- High-quality WAV recording (44.1kHz, 128kbps)
- Removed complex WebSocket streaming
- Simplified BASE64 conversion
- Consistent backend URLs
- Clean JSON payload format

ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:
1. Run: npm install
2. Run: npm start
3. Test voice recording in the app
4. Say: "Hi I am this"
5. Verify transcription accuracy

ðŸ”§ Technical Details:
- Sample Rate: 16kHz â†’ 44.1kHz (HIGH QUALITY)
- Bit Rate: 64kbps â†’ 128kbps (BETTER QUALITY)
- Architecture: Streaming â†’ Simple Record/Process
- Dependencies: Removed socket.io-client
- Backend URL: Consistent across platforms

ðŸ“¤ Backend Integration:
Your backend endpoint /process-response/ will now receive:
{
  "audio_bytes": "<high-quality-wav-base64>",
  "previous_question": "...",
  "user_info": {...}
}

ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:
Input: "Hi I am this"
Output: Accurate transcription (not "You or Boom")

Happy coding! ðŸš€
